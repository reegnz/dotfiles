# This script allows using your current AWS environment credentials as
# environment variables. This acts mainly as a wrapper for tools that cannot
# make sense of newer credential sources, like credential_process or
# WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE. With this wrapper you simply wrap the original
# command, and have it translate the credentials for you.
#
# Pitfall: the credentials don't get renewed, so the application that is
# wrapped will need to be stopped and wrapped again once the session expires.
